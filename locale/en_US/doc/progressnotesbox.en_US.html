Progress notes can be entered in the standard SOAP format or they can be entered all on one page on the Interval page.

<LI> Standard Soap Note Format</LI>
<UL>
    As one can see, various portions of the note can be entered in each of the tabbed sections which include Subjective,
    Objective, Assessment, Plan, Vitals, Rx and Education. Each of these sections contains an HTML editor so that the note
    be written with different types, sizes and colors of fonts, the background color can be chosen, the text can be 
    bolded and underlined and the position on the page can be determined.</br>
    These notes can be printed only through the browser print mechanism</UL>
<P>

<LI> Interval Note Format</LI>
<UL>
    In this format, the note is written on one page.  HTML formatting is not included so that the note can be entered
    with voice dictation.  Notes entered here can be printed as a nicely formatted PDF file using the FreeMED print button
    found just to the right of the progress note description.</UL>
<P>
On the Basic Information page, one can choose to use a template to create the major portion of the note.
<UL>
   <I>Template Creation:</I> To create a new template, click on "Add" next to the sentence "Progress Notes Template".  This will take you
       to a new screen where you can enter the name of the template, enter the note in the various categories and then click on "Modify".</br>
       If at a later date, one wants to change the template, just click on the "Edit" button.</br> 
       The best way to remove a template is to rename it "z", erase all of the fields and then click on "Modify".</br> 
       To use a template, choose the name of the desired template and then click the "Use" button. This enters the templates into the fields 
       of the note.  Then click on the tabs where you might want to enter changes to complete the note.</UL>
<P>
Once the note has been created, enter the name of the provider, the initals of the typist (if desired), the description of the note and the
related episodes (if desired). Then click on "Add" on the bottom of the page to add the note.</br>
If one is using the Progress Note Box module, then one can enter scanned of faxed progress notes here.  This is useful if a patient is seen in
the office and then later is seen in an extended care facility. The notes from the extended care facility can be faxed directly into FreeMED 
and added as a progress note.
