Welcome to FreeMED, the world's premiere web-based
open-source practice management and electronic medical
record software!

<P>

The main menu is the center of FreeMED's navigation. From
here, you can use access any part of the FreeMED software.
On the top of this page there are five navigation buttons
named System, Main, User, Patients and Notify.  The function of 
the categories under each of these navigation buttons will 
be discussed in separate help screens as you navigate through
FreeMED. On the Main Menu page you will see the following categories:

<P>

<UL>

        <LI> <I>Messages</I> - Directly below the navigation buttons is
        a notification displaying the number of messages which have been sent
        to the user.  Clicking on this notification will take you to the 
	message center containing the messages.  One can also access the 
	message center by clicking on "Unread Messages" near the bottom 
	of this screen or by clicking on the envelope next to the name of 
	the user at the very bottom of the screen.

	<LI><I>Patient Scheduler</I> - This displays the number of appointments
	that the provider has. Clicking in "you have x appointmnent(s) today" 
	will take you to the user's daily schedule.  This daily schedule can 
	also be reached by clicking on User -> Day View. Clicking on 
	"x appointment(s) this week" will take you to the weekly schedule 
	which can also be reached by clicking on User -> Week View.


	<LI><I>Work Lists</I> -You may not see this category unless it has been 
	enabled for you. To enable viewing of work lists, click on 
	Main -> Administrative Menu -> System Configuration -> Work Lists and 
	then choose enable and the users who will see it.
	Once Work Lists are enabled you will see all of the patients coming to 
	the office today, the time of their appointments and their status.
	If you click on the letters directly beneath the word Status, you will 
	see a drop-down list of A3C (Anticipating Arrival at Counter), 
	CIAC (Checked in at Counter), E/PIP (Encounter/Procedure in Progress), 
	E/PIC (Encounter/Procedure is Complete), CO (Checked out) and NS (No Show). 
	If you forget what these letter mean, just put the mouse pointer in the 
	letters without clicking. You will then see the explanation for each set 
	of letters.</br>
	If you want to add more categories, click on Main -> Support Data ->
	Scheduler Status Type.  You can also change the color that is associated
	with each of the categories.</br>
	If you see that the work list of a provider lists a time with the words
	"Non-Patient Related", it means that the provider 
	has a non-patient related scheduled activity.  The provider may be 
	traveling from the hospital to the office for instance.

        <LI><I>Updates</I> This displays secruity feed update information.
	If desired, one can remove this category from view by changing the 
	name of updates.module.php in the /usr/share/freemed/modules directory.

	<LI><I>Unread Faxes</I> - If this menu is present, it means that the 
	provider has received faxes or scanned records that the provider must
	review. Clicking on "Read" will take you to the list of the records 
	which must be reviewed.  Then clicking on "View" will display the 
	record.   

	<LI><I> Unread Messages</I> - If this menu is present, it means 
	that the provider has received messages from other users.  Clicking 
	on "View" will take you to the message center containing the messages. 
	One can also reach the message center by clicking on the envelope 
	next to the name of the user at the very bottom of the screen. 
	The features of the Message Center are explained in the "Messages" 
	category above.

	<LI><I>Unfiled Faxes</I> - If this menu is present, it means that 
	records have been scanned or faxed into FreeMED. "Unfiled Faxes" 
	are generally viewed by the staff. To set who will see Unfiled Faxes, 
	go to Main -> Administrative Menu -> System Configuration -> 
	Unfiled Faxes. You can then set who will see Unfiled Faxes. If you 
	click on [File], you will be taken to list of all Unfiled Faxes. 
	You can "Del" a document or you can "View" it.
	If you click on View, you will see the document. You will also see the

	department to see which procedures are ready to be billed.
	You can add a  Suberbill like this by clicking on a patient's chart
	going to the Progress Notes module, clicking on Add and clicking on
	the Superbill tab.  This is explained more fully in the Help Menu of
	Progress Notes Box module.

	<LI><I> Letter Corrections</I> - If this menu is present, you are a 
	typist who has typed a letter for a provider.  The provider has 
	added suggested corrections and returned the letter to you so that
	you can make the indicated corrections.

	<LI><I> Unread Letters</I> - If this menu is present, you will see 
	letters which have been typed by a typist and returned to the provider 
	for proof-reading and correction.  After the letters are approved, the 
	secretary can then fax or print the letters.
