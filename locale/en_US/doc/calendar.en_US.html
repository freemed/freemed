To reach Calendar topics, click on Main -> Calendar
You will see three sections.
<UL>

<LI><strong> Anesthesiology Calendar</strong></LI>
This section is useful to Ambulatory Surgical Centers.  If you click on Anesthesiology 
Calendar, you will see a Anesthesiology scheduling screen.  This will allow you to set the 
dates when anesthesia providers are present at the Surgery Center.  This is useful if a 
surgeon has a preference for a specific anesthesia provider. Operations booked by a specific
surgeon can then be scheduled on the day when the desired anesthesia provider is present.
</LI>
<LI><strong> Daily Appointments</strong></LI>
This section is useful for printing a provider's schedule.  If you click on "Daily 
Appointments", you will be taken to a screen that allows you to enter the date of the 
calendar and the name of provider whose schedule you would like to display. After you have 
chosen the date and the name of the provider, click on "Select Provider".  This will 
display the schedule in an easily printable format.  The schedule includes the date, time, 
account number, patient name, age, gender, DOB, provider, home phone and work phone.  This 
is the only calendar that displays all of this information.
<LI><strong> Group Calendar</strong></LI>
If you click on Group Calendar, you will be taken to the calendar of the group 
that was chosen on the login screen. This  daily calendar displays the calendar
of all of the members in the group.  This calendar is useful for staff members 
to determine office flow patterns on and to determine when office time is 
available for a particular provider.</br>
To change the time of an appointment that day or to change the provider who the
patient will see that day, put the mouse on the blank space to right of the 
word "Move" and then drag the appointment to the desired location.</br>
To change the date and time of the appointment to another day, click on the 
word "Move".
This will take you to another screen where you can chose the desired date of 
the appointment. Then click on the desired time of the appointment.  This will 
take you to another screen where you can change the note attached to the 
appointment and then you can click on "Confirm Booking" to set the 
appointment.</br>
You can also book an appointment from this calendar.  If you click on an open 
slot, you will be taken to a screen that allows you to chose the name of the 
patient and an associated appointment template.  You have to choose a previously
created template or the appointment won't be created properly.</br>  
The creation of templates is discussed in the section "Appointment Templates" 
found by going to Main -> Support Data -> Appointment Templates.</br>
On this same screen, you can also choose to book non-patient related activities
such as travel (the default), staff meetings, etc.   First choose the activity 
and then click on the length of time to create this type of appointment.</br> 
These activity templates are created by clicking on Main -> Administration Menu
-> System Configuration -> Group Calendar.
