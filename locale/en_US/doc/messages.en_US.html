FreeMED contains an intraoffice messaging system so that messages regarding patients will become a part of the medical record. To associate messages with patients whose charts you are viewing, click in System -> Preferences -> Change User Options -> Messaging: Forget recent patient: No.</br>
In the intraoffice messaging system you can:

<LI><I>"Send Message" (send a new message) to another user.</I>

<LI><I> View "Old Messages" which you saved.</I>

<LI><I> Return to the "Main Menu",</I>

<LI><I> "Select All" messages in case you want to mark them all for deletion 
   or if you want to save them all.</I>

<LI><I> Click on "Mark as Read", to move the message into "Old Messages".</I>

<LI><I> "Delete Marked Messages" to delete the messages that have a check mark 
   in front of them.</I>

<LI><I>Beneath the Inbox there is an arrow with a drop down menu. The drop down
   menu displays the "Sent" category and any other
   mail boxes that you have created. To create a 
   new mail box put the cursor in the box to the right of the box that contains
   the ---> symbol. (The cursor can't be seen in 
   this box but it is there). Then type the name of the mailbox
   that you would like. Now put a check mark in front of the 
   message that you would like to save in
   this new mail box. Now click on "Tag". This automatically creates the new
   mail box and moves the message into it.</I>
