You may have several form letters that you tend to send to patients.  Examples 
might be notification of test results, biopsy reports, notes to employer, 
etc.</br>  
You can choose to use a template to create the major portion of the letter.
<UL>
   <I>Template Creation:</I> To create a new template, click on "Add" next to 
   the sentence "Progress Notes Template".  This will take you to a new screen 
   where you can enter the name of the template, enter the form letter and then
   click on "Modify".</br>
   If at a later date, you want to change the template, just click on the 
   "Edit" button.</br>
   The best way to remove a template is to rename it "z", erase all of the 
   fields and then click on "Modify".</br>
   To use a template, choose the name of the desired template and then click 
   the "Use" button. This enters the template into the letter.
      </UL>
<P>
After you have chosen the template, you can associate the letter with a 
particular episode of care.</br>
Then enter the date of the letter.</br>
Choose the sender.</br>
Make any changes you would like to make in the letter.</br>
You can then "Cancel" out of this module, "Clear" what you have written or
"Add" to enter the letter into FreeMED.</br>  
Notice!! You should not write the patient's address, Sincerely, and your 
printed name.</br>  
If you have entered your scanned signature, then the word 
Sincerely, your scanned signature and your typed name with your degree will be 
added to the letter.This will be displayed when you click on the print icon 
in Freemed next to the letter.</br> 
The letter will be properly formatted.
<P>
<P>

If the letter was a typed document such as a MSWord document, you can "Browse"
to the letter file and then add it. If you do this, remember that the MSword
printing codes are incompatible with the TEX printing codes in FreeMED. You
will be able to view such a letter but you will not be able to print copies of
this type of letter later.</br>
A better solution is to scan the letter into FreeMED. Scanned letter can be
added to the Letters Box module. Scanned letters and typed letters will display
and print properly from FreeMED.
