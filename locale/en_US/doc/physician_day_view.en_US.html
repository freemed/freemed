This screen displays the user's complete daily schedule.</br>
At the very top is a button to take you to the user's "Week View"</br>
On the same line on which the "Week View" words are displayed you will see < and > symbols to take you to the previous or the next day.</br>
Below the "Physician Name" is a calendar which allows you to pick the day that you would like to view. Clicking on "prev" takes you to the previous month and clicking on the number 3 adjacent to "prev" takes you back three months.</br>
If you click on a patient's name, you will be taken to that patient's chart.</br>
If you click on the word "Move", you will be taken to a new screen where you can choose the date and time to which the appointment can be moved.</br>
You may see different colors for specific appointments.  For instance the color
for a travel appointment is light blue and the color for a double booked 
appointment can be set to any color you would like.</br>
