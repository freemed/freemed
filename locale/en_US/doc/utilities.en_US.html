There are three Utilities available:
<P>
<UL>

     <LI><span style="text-decoration: underline;">EMR Attachements:</span></br> 
     This utility makes it possible to move documents from one chart to 
     another.     
     This is useful if a document was misfiled into an incorrect chart.<br />
     To use this utility click on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
     EMR Attachements.</span></br>
     In the next screen you will select the patient whose chart contains the
     misfiled attachment.  If the you have brought up this utility while you
     are in a patient's chart, then the name of the patient will automatically
     be added in the blank.  If you wish to change the name of the patient, then
     click in the blank and start typing the name of the patient.</br>
     Click on Next</br>
     In the next screen you can choose the attachments that you would like to 
     transfer.  The drop down menu will show all of the attachments which can
     be chosen. Multiple attachments can be chosen.</br>
     Once you have chosen the attachments you want to move, click on Next</br>
     In the next screen you can choose the Destination Patient and then click
     on Finish.</br>
     The attachments will now be in the chart of the Destination Patient.<P>
     <LI><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fax Multiple Attachments:
     </span></br>
     This utility allows one to fax multiple attachments.  If you are in a 
     patient's chart and would like to fax a letter, then you can only attach
     <span style="text-decoration: underline;">one attachment</span> to the 
     letter.</br> 
     With this utility, you can choose to fax as may attachments as you would
     like.</br>
     After you have clicked on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fax 
     Multiple Attachments</span>, you will be taken to the next screen where
     you can select the patient.</br>
     Then click on Next .</br>
     In the next screen you can choose all of the attachments that you would 
     like to fax. Then click on Next .</br>
     In the next screen, you can choose the name of the Destination Provider.
     If the Provider has not been entered in the Support Data, then you can
     add the Provider by clicking on the + sign.  This will bring up the 
     Provider entry screen where you would add all of the pertinent data 
     including the address and fax number.</br>
     Once you have chose the Destination Provider, click on Finish to 
     fax the attachments.<P>
     <LI><span style="text-decoration: underline;">View All Unread Faxes:
     </span></br>
     This utility allows all users to view faxes that have been sent to the 
     providers for their review.  An illustration will help one understand
     why this utility is useful.  Let us say, that a patient calls and would
     like to know the result of a CT scan or a pathology report.  If this 
     report has been sent to a provider for review, then staff members cannot 
     see the report since they cannot see a provider's Unread Faxes. By 
     clicking on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">View All Unread Faxes
     </span> one is taken to a screen that shows all of the reports that are
     in all of the providers' Unread Faxes.
