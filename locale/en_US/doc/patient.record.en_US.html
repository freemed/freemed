The core EMR of FreeMED is located in the "patient" table of the database,
and is split into several logical sections, which are represented as "tabs"
when adding or modifying a patient record.</br>
If you do not wish to see the multiple tabs while registering a patient and 
prefer to have one large entry screen, click on Main -> Administrative Menu 
-> System Configuration -> Fold Multipage Forms?, choose "no" and then click 
on "Configure" on the bottom of the screen.

<P>
