Unfiled Faxes - If this menu is present, it means that records have been scanned or faxed into FreeMED. "Unfiled Faxes" are generally viewed by the staff.</br>
To set who will see Unfiled Faxes, go to Main -> Administrative Menu -> System Configuration -> Unfiled Faxes. You can then choose who will see Unfiled Faxes.</br>
If you are on the Main Page and you click on "File" in the Unfiled Faxes box, you will be taken to another screen that displays the list of faxes or scanned records that have been received.</br>. You can "Del" a document or you can "View" it. If you click on View, you will see the document and data that has to be attached to file the document.</br>
You need to attach a "Date" the document. This is usually the date that the document was generated, such as the date of an operative report. In the next blank you can choose the name of the patient with whom the document is associated. Typing just a portion of the name will enter the complete patient name. In Physician, one would set the Health Care provider whose name is on the document and who should see it. Next to "Type" is a drop down menu that lets you choose where the document will be filed, ie. whether it will be filed as an operative report, laboratory report, radiology report, etc.. Next to "Note" you can write what the document is such as: Right hemicolectomy, adenocarcinoma with penetration of wall with extension in the adjacent fat, etc. Next to "Notify", you would enter the name of another person who should be aware of this report. For instance, you would want to notify the billing department when you are filing an operative report. Next to "Fax Confirmation" you would enter the phone number of the medical records department of the hospital if that department request an acknowledgment that you have received the fax. Once the document is filed, the acknowledgment will automatically be sent to the medical records department. You would click on "Flip" if you have received a fax upside down and you want to file it right side up. You can then click on "Send to Provider" so that it will be seen by the provider as an Unread Fax. You can click on "Send to Provider without First Page". You would do this if the cover page is unimportant. You can click on "File Directly". This will file the document in the patient's chart. You would do this in case of documents that have been reviewed at the hospital or elsewhere already. You can click on "File directly without First Page". This files the document in the chart without the cover page. You can click on "Split Batch". If you have received one fax from the hospital containing multiple records, you can split the batch and then file the documents individually. You can click on "Cancel" to stop viewing this document and to go back to the list of "Unfiled Faxes". You can "Delete" the document (in case of duplicates for instance).
