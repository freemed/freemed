<LI>In the <I>User</I> tab, one sets the "Username" and the "Password".  If you enter a password,
complete the registration process and then later return to this screen, you will see that
there are many more stars in the Password box then what you entered.  This is due to 
encryption of the password and is not an error.</br>
