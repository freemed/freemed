<UL> 

       <LI> <I>Change Password</I> - Clicking on "Change Password" will allow the user to change his or her login password.
       <LI> <I>Change Template Options</I> - Clicking on "Change Template Options" is a feature that has not been implemented.
       <LI> <I>Change User Options</I> - Clicking on "Change User Options" allows the user to change the following categories:</br>
A. "Messaging Forget Recent Patient". This is best explained by examples.
Let us say the user is in the chart of a patient and wants to send a message regarding this patient and wants the message to become a part of the patient's record. In that case, the user would change this option to "no".
However, if a user frequently sends messages that have to do with office routines such as general billing procedures, and these messages are not associated with a particular patient, then the user would set this option to "yes".</br>
B. "Skip Printer Selection". This is usually left on yes.
If this is set to no, a user can then set the address of a networked printer. This may be useful if a person is typing notes or letters for a satellite office that is on the network but is far away. In that case, the typist can print notes on the printer at the satellite office, rather than making long distance telephone calls to fax the typed notes or letters.</br>
C. "Date Widget". Next to this category is a drop down list.</br>
1. "system default". Same as "java-script widget" which will be explained next.</br>
2. "javascript widget". If a user needs to choose a date such as the date of a progress note or the date of a fax, then if this widget is chosen, a calendar will be displayed from which the user can pick the appropriate date.</br>
3. "split text entry". If a user needs to choose a date such as the date of a progress note or the date of a fax, then if this widget is chosen, three drop down menus will appear that let the user choose the day, month and year.</br>
D. "Booking Refresh". This is best explained by example. If a user is booking an appointment and enters the length of the appointment (which is a bit of data) and then enters the booking location (another bit of data), then this data needs to be remembered. If Booking Refresh is set to "yes", the page refreshes after every bit of data is entered and the data will be remembered. If the user then chooses another date for this appointment, the data will carry over to the new date. If another date is chosen when Booking Refresh is set to "no", the data will be lost.
Some users find it disturbing to have frequent page refreshes. They prefer to set Booking refresh to "no", enter all the data and then click on the refresh button.</br>
E. "Default Room". If a user wished to have a default room for his appointments, the user can set this here.
