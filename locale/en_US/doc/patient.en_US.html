If you are seeing this help screen while seeking help as you are 
modifying the patient registration information, go to the 
%%Patient Registration,patient,record%% to see the appropriate help screen.

<P>

The main patient selection screen allows you to select a patient based on
a wide range of criteria. The "Show All Patients" link is provided only when
the number of patients in the system is very small, as large numbers of
patients produce prohibitively large pages to scroll through.

<P>

Patient Selection Methods:

<UL>    
        <LI><I>Patients by Name</I> - Displays all patients whose last name
	start with the specified letter. This works well in smaller practices,
	but may become a problem in larger settings, where its use is
	strongly discouraged.

	<LI><I>Patients Field Search</I> - Allows searching on a patient's
	vital information (name, address, et cetera). It currently searches
	on a <ABBR TITLE="portion of the full text">substring</ABBR> for
	any of the pieces of patient information listed in its dropbox.

	<LI><I>Soundalike Search</I> - Searches via a
	<ABBR TITLE="mathematical representation of a words' pronunciation"
	>soundex</ABBR> key any of the fields listed in its dropbox.

	<LI><I>Patient Smart Search</I> - Enter a portion of the first name,
	leave one space and enter a portion of the last name. The names of 
	the patients fitting the search criteria will appear. Click on the 
	desired name to be taken to the patient's chart.</br>
	You can also enter a portion of the last name, enter a comma, leave
	one space and enter a portion of the first name to obtain the same
	result.
	

</UL>

If one finds that the desired patient information does not exist in the system,
one can click on "Add Patient" to be taken to the patient registration screen.</br>
If one finds that the desired patient information does not exist in the system,
and would just like to leave a message regarding a person who might possibly 
become a patient, one can click on the "Call In Menu".
