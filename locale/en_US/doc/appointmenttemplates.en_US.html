This module allows the creation of <strong>Appointment Templates.</strong>
<UL>
<LI> If you click on <strong>ADD</strong>, you will be taken to another screen
where you can enter the name of the new template and the length of the 
appointment for this template(for instance a suture removal template will be 
short and a new patient evaluation will be longer).</br>
You can then add any required equipment.  For purposes of illustration, if a
colonoscope is needed and the colonoscope is only found in the endoscopy room,
then when this template is used, it will only allow booking of appointments
when the endoscopy room is available.</br>
You can then choose the color of the template.</br>
Then click "Add" to create the template.</br>
The newly created template will be seen if you go to Main -> Calendar ->
Group Calendar.  Once you are in this calendar, click on an empty appointment
slot.  The template choices  will then be displayed in the new screen in the 
drop down menu below the word "Template:".</LI>
<LI> Once the template has been created, you can click on <strong>MOD</strong>
to modify the template as desired.</LI>
<LI> If the template is no longer needed, you can <Strong>DEL</strong>elete it.
