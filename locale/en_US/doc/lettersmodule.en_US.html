If you write a new letter, you:

<P>

<UL>
  <LI><I> Can associate the letter with a specific episode of care</I>

  <LI><I> Choose the date of the letter</I>

  <LI><I> Choose the name of the sender</I>

  <LI><I> Choose the name of the recipient</I>

   <LI><I> Choose recipients who will receive a carbon copy of the letter</I>

   <LI><I> Choose the names of any enclosures that will be sent with the letter<?I>

<P>

</UL>

You can then type the letter.

<P>

<UL>

If you want to use the Firefox spell checker, click on the <> symbol to toggle to the html source and then use the spell checker.  If you do this, you will preserve the proper printing codes when you print the pdf version of this letter.</UL>

<P>

Then enter the date of the letter.</br>
Choose the sender.</br>
Make any changes you would like to make in the letter.</br>
You can then "Cancel" out of this module, "Clear" what you have written or
"Add" to enter the letter into FreeMED.</br>
Notice!! You should not write the patient's address, Sincerely, and your
printed name.</br>
If you have entered your scanned signature, then the word
Sincerely, your scanned signature and your typed name with your degree will be
added to the letter.This will be displayed when you click on the print icon
in Freemed next to the letter.</br>
The letter will be properly formatted.

<P>

If the letter was a typed document such as a MSWord document, you can "Browse" 
to the letter file and then add it. If you do this, remember that the MSword 
printing codes are incompatible with the TEX printing codes in FreeMED. You 
will be able to view such a letter but you will not be able to print copies of 
this type of letter later.</br>
A better solution is to scan the letter into FreeMED. Scanned letter can be 
added to the Letters Box module. Scanned letters and typed letters will display
and print properly from FreeMED.
